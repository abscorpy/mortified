A ghost is a soul that has left its body, usually because the body has
died. Most ghosts do not stay around for long before they leave for the sky or
the earth. A ghost can possess a [corpse](Corpse.md), turning it into a [zombie](Zombie.md). If the corpse has decayed into a [skeleton](SkeletalCorpse.md), it
becomes an [undead skeleton](UndeadSkeleton.md) instead.

Most ghosts are not determined or powerful enough to possess a corpse on their
own. A necromancer can cast [Deadlock](Deadlock.md) to bind a ghost to a
corpse, turning it into a loyal undead servant.
