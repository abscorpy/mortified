A particle-based [spell](Spell.md) that freezes its target. The ice particles can
also form a slippery ice coating on surfaces, though the amount of ice created
by the spell is very small. The spell can be directed at a body of water to
create much greater quantities of ice in the form of floating [ice blocks](IceBlock.md). If an entire body of water is frozen, an [ice elemental](IceElemental.md) is
created. Ice particles become [snow flakes](SnowFlake.md) when their speed is
sufficiently low.
