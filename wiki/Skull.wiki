A container for spell particles. The skulls can be filled with spell particles
and thrown as grenades. Particle decay is halted while the particles are inside
a skull, though they slowly but visibly leak out over time. The skull explodes
on impact, firing the particles in all directions. The skull is consumed in the
process, so the thrower must stock up with new skulls regularly.
