A particle-based [Spells spell] that freezes its target. The ice particles can also form a slippery ice coating on surfaces, though the amount of ice created by the spell is very small. The spell can be directed at a body of water to create much greater quantities of ice in the form of floating ice blocks. If an entire body of ice is frozen, an ice elemental is created. Ice particles become snow flakes when their speed is sufficiently low.
