A particle-based [Spell spell] that freezes its target. The ice particles can also form a slippery ice coating on surfaces, though the amount of ice created by the spell is very small. The spell can be directed at a body of water to create much greater quantities of ice in the form of floating [IceBlock ice blocks]. If an entire body of ice is frozen, an [IceElemental ice elemental] is created. Ice particles become [SnowFlake snow flakes] when their speed is sufficiently low.
