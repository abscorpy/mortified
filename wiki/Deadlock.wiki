Deadlock is a [Necromancy necromantic] [Spell spell] of [Binding binding].

When a corpse absorbs a binding particle, its binding power increases. Absorbing the particle causes the corpse to twitch and glow. The corpse enters a binding state when the binding power is sufficiently high considering the size of the corpse. While in the binding state, the corpse can attract and bind a nearby ghost to rise as an undead.

The binding power of a corpse diminishes over time, potentially causing it to leave a previously entered binding state.
