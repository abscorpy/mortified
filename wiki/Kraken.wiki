An underwater, many-armed, squid-like, ink-firing [Boss boss]. The kraken spawns miniature versions of itself. The hero kills it by severing all arms. (The severed arms bleed, attracting sharks?) The [Arena arena] is near a shore or on the bottom of the sea. The arena could contain a shipwreck. The kraken tears down platforms and throws boulders with its arms.
