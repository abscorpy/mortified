A ghost is a soul that has left its body, usually because the body has died. Most ghosts do not stay around for long before they leave for the sky or the earth. A ghost can possess a [Corpse corpse], turning it into a [Zombie zombie]. If the corpse has decayed into a [BonePile bone pile], it becomes a [Skeleton skeleton] instead. Most ghosts are not determined or powerful enough to possess a corpse on their own. A necromancer can cast [WakeUpCall Wake Up Call] to bind a ghost to a corpse, turning it into a loyal undead servant.
