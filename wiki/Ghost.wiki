A ghost is a soul that has left its body, usually because the body has
died. Most ghosts do not stay around for long before they leave for the sky or
the earth. A ghost can possess a [Corpse corpse], turning it into a [Zombie
zombie]. If the corpse has decayed into [SkeletalRemains skeletal remains], it
becomes an [UndeadSkeleton undead skeleton] instead.

Most ghosts are not determined or powerful enough to possess a corpse on their
own. A necromancer can cast [Spellbind] to bind a ghost to a
corpse, turning it into a loyal undead servant.
