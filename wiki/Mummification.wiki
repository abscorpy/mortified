#labels GameDesign

Mummifying a [Corpse corpse] prevents it from rotting further. The treatment
must be carried out in a [Workshop workshop] and requires [SpiderSilk spider silk] for wrapping the [MummifiedCorpse mummified corpse]. A [Zombie zombie] can be mummified to make an [UndeadMummy undead mummy].
