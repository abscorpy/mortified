[Magic](Magic.md) streams can be channeled by creatures and items called [channelers](Channeler.md). A [wizard](Wizard.md) is also a channeler. Channeling affects the following aspects of the magic particles:

  * Creation rate and clustering
  * Initial direction and speed
  * Forces acting during lifetime
  * Decay based on lifetime and range
