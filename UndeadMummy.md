Mummies are [undead](Undead.md) that have been [mummified](Mummification.md) to prevent them from rotting. They are made by either [raising](Reanimation.md) [mummified corpses](MummifiedCorpse.md) or mummifying [zombies](Zombie.md).

Mummies are considerably stronger than zombies. Their greatest weakness is fire. In fact, their chemical treatment and wrapping make them burn like torches.
